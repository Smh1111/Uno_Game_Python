This is a simple Uno card game. The game is like a landmine game. You don't know the 
lucky card or the correct card that the program has chosen at the beginning. 
(It could be the bad card if you want to think other way around.)

                                HOW TO PLAY

There is only one way to find out. It is to click out each card and wait for the pop-up
warning box that will pop up if you found the correct box and the program will ask you
whether you start a new game or not. 

If it doesn't pop up, you are okay to click next card and look for the card.

                                MODES: 
Two modes

Single player mode : You play with an AI that will automatically choose the next card
Multiplayer mode   : You play with your friends or you play alone
